	Notes:
		- YOU CAN find the name of each selection and its data type in class "UserSelections"
		- take care that ( 1. {"key1" : ,"key2" : "1" } give error because 'key1' not take value
								you can put "key1" : null its okay with any data type
								you can put "key1" : -1 or 0 if its 'integer'
								you can put "key1" : "" if its 'string' 
		- if "key1" is string but carry "123..." or any integers we can use 
			"key1" : 123 -  "key1" : "123" 
			booth are okay
		
		- if wallet balance < amountToPay , it return that wallet is not enough
		- creditCard is handled here as a simulation with every credit card payment, money is 10000
		  credit id must be a valid credit card number so  i put it in code to decreasing the load
		  in each input

	// recharge Internet by "200" as default value to be recharged
	 * look like you are on a specific plan with the internet service provider and this plan 
	 * is 200 LE for 200 GB as an example
    {
    "ServiceNumber": "2", "ServiceProviderNumber": 1, "CreditCardOrWallet" :2,
    "LandLineNumber" : "+20123456"

    "amoubtToPay":350,"LandLineNumber" : "+20123456"
    }
    
    Note:
    	- as we see here its the same steps we discuss in mobile recharge and the same algorithm is used
    	- only the one difference that even if you change "amountToPay" : 123 or any number the number that
    	  will consume from wallet or credit card is 200 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    //LandLineRecipt
     * again here we make the same steps but 
     * ++++ important ++++ the variable "serviceProvider" is created to choose 
     * [1. Quarter recipt (300.0),	2. monthly recipt(150.0) ] and these amount to changes by chage
     * "amountToPay" variable
     * 
    {
    "ServiceNumber": 3, "ServiceProviderNumber":2, "CreditCardOrWallet" :2,
	"LandLineNumber2" : "+2012345678"
    }
    
     // example here even we put "amountToPay" = 350 , the amount that will be payed
     * is still  150 or 300, depend on "ServiceProviderNumber" = ? , 
    {
    "ServiceNumber": "3", "ServiceProviderNumber": 1, "CreditCardOrWallet" :2,
    "amoubtToPay":350,"LandLineNumber2" : "+20123456"
    }
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //Donate for organization "you can choose where to donate"
     * again the same steps and here we can use "amountToPay" normaly and it will be the real amount 
     * that will be payed
     * ++++ important ++++ the variable "serviceProvider" is created to choose between thedifferent Organization 
    {
    "ServiceNumber": 4, "ServiceProviderNumber":1, "CreditCardOrWallet" :1,
    "amoubtToPay":100

	{
    "ServiceNumber": "5", "amountAddedToWallet" :100
    }
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // return all the services that are started with "lan" , ignore the lower or upper case 
     * it will works on the both 
    {
    "ServiceNumber": "6", "ServiceToSearch":"s"
    }
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// ask for refund
	 * and return message "transaction with id 41741 is now in refund list"

    {
    "ServiceNumber": "7", "transactionToRefund":"41741"

    Note:
    	- when the transaction added to the refund lest its "status" will change to "Waiting for refund"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	// show all transactions
